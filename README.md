# FinanceBot: News Research Tool

FinanceBot is a user-friendly Streamlit-based application designed to help you analyze and summarize news articles. Simply provide URLs of news articles, and the bot will process the content, store it in a FAISS index, and allow you to ask questions about the articles with answers generated by OpenAI's language model.


## Features

* Process News Articles: Input up to three article URLs to extract and analyze content.

* Text Splitting: Automatically splits long articles into manageable chunks for efficient processing.

* Embeddings and FAISS Index: Creates vector embeddings of the text and stores them in a FAISS index for quick retrieval.

* Question Answering: Ask questions about the content of the articles and get accurate answers with source citations.
